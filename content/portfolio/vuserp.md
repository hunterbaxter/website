After my summer internship as a research intern at the [Institute of Software Integrated Systems](https://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/),
specifically in the [SCOPE Lab](https://scopelab.ai/),
under the supervision of [Abhishek Dubey](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5J3w9OoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao),
I participated in a poster session where I presented what I worked on during my internsip.

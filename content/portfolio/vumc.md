This project manifested itself through a project named Expected Value (name chosen by coworker).
Expected Value was a startup through the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Medical Innovators Development Program (MIDP) and the Vanderbilt University Wondâ€™ry builder program.
My role on this project was to design and implement a data pipeline and machine learning model using Python and mySQL which would classify if patients would be readmitted in near future.
I also designed the API used to communicate with the front-end of our project which allowed our model to be deployed through a SMART on FHIR application through a patient dashboard.
The result of this project was a *19.33% performance increase* over the model used by the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
